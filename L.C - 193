The problem was to read out each line of phone numbers from a file.
There are a bunch of different ways to do this but I used extended grep or grep -E

grep -e ^([0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}|\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4})$

Lets break it down;

the ^ shows the start of the line and the $ shows the end.

[0-9]{3} 
the 0-9 is any single digit between 0 and 9. 
the {3} is how many times to repeat so in this case repeat 3 times. 

WHY? we need to repeat it 3 times because of the phone number structure. 
3 digits - 3 digits and then 4. So we have it search from 0-9 3 times for the first part of the PH number, the 2nd and then we actually set it to 4 for the last section. 

The next section is | \( [0-9]{3} \) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}) 

the | that looks like a pipe is actually the OR symbol in Regex. 

\() part is for a grouping and then escapes with \ as well. So it seems like its looking for literally, the () symbol in the phone number. 

So what this is saying is that  to return if it looks like this; (123) 456-7890 OR this, 123 456-7890
