My approach was to use awk for this but you can use others. 

awk reads input line by line. 
so $1 for example will be line 1 and so on. 

so we need it to loop through each line of the file. 

awk '{
for (n = 1; n <= NF; n++} {
print $n
}
}' <file name> 

This section right here will just return each line but we need to some how find the occurance of each bit right? 

We use Sort | uniq here. 


awk '{ for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) print $i }' words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{ print $2, $1 }'

So we use sort, and then we want to collapse the entries by uniqueness so its not just repeating entries. 

Sort -nr has the flag to sort it numerically vs alphabetically, and reverse the order so the biggest is on top. 

the last awk is just to print everything out.
